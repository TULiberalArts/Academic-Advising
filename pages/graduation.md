Students enrolled in a degree-program, such as a **Certificate, Bachelor, Master, or Doctoral degree**, should [apply to graduate](https://registrar.temple.edu/apply-to-graduate) when they become degree-eligible. Students should regularly meet with their academic advisors to ensure academic program requirements are being met. Review the general [graduation processing timeline](https://registrar.temple.edu/graduation-processing-timeline) to learn when your degree will be transcripted, diplomas awarded, etc. Upon review of your academic history, if it is determined that you have NOT met all necessary degree requirements, you will be notified by an academic advisor through your Temple email account. _**Please email [claugrad@temple.edu](mailto:claugrad@temple.edu) if you have any graduation-related questions.**_
